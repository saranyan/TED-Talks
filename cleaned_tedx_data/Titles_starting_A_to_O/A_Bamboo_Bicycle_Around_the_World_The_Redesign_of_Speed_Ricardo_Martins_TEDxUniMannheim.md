when you hear there is a guy cycling
around the world on a bamboo bicycle I&#39;m
pretty sure you&#39;re a big attention it&#39;s
not going to the word guy which means me
but to the bamboo bicycle things yeah I
know I&#39;m the number two let&#39;s keep all
this alright so let me introduce to you
to the big star of this trip yeah this
is dual Sania
this is Dulcinea my bamboo bicycle
she is strong enough to cross the whole
world with me and she&#39;s actually
handmade customized just for me and I
actually know it&#39;s kind of creepy if I
refer to my bicycle using Chi and yeah
but wait wait wait it&#39;s gonna be even
creepier because I really I truly think
love is a thing that you feel for
bicycles if not it&#39;s just passion well
anyway my ex-girlfriends didn&#39;t like it
that much but again let&#39;s say this is
our long honeymoon around the world okay
so so yeah we have started in April of
2016 so one year and five months ago
14,000 kilometers crossing Africa to
come here to Germany so we&#39;ve started in
Cape Town Cape to Cairo the classic so
then from South Africa to Swaziland
Mozambique Tanzania Kenya Ethiopia Sudan
Egypt and now it&#39;s Europe time I&#39;m so
excited about that and after here we go
into Asia and then to Australia back to
Asia to the north to Alaska and then
going down from North America to Central
America and then Rio de Janeiro Brazil
where I am from by the way yeah now the
second one that&#39;s me I&#39;m Ricardo
Martin&#39;s I&#39;m 32 and I&#39;m a social
scientist from Brazil and before this
trip I&#39;ve done for years cycling around
South America starting with $130 yeah it
wasn&#39;t that cool but after that I
brought my first
book and for my surprise I&#39;ve started
making presentations around my country
talking about different simple ways to
achieve new dreams and break new
challenges my honest intention was
talking about how to do all this stuff
even being an idiot like I am but for
some reason it wasn&#39;t catchy enough you
know because guys you have to understand
the big expectation of death so look at
that picture alright there&#39;s a guy
coming to talk to you yeah pleased to
meet you so this guy is cycling around
the world on a bamboo bicycle and he
just crossed Africa to come here to talk
to you that down and then it&#39;s just me
yeah I know I&#39;m not that strong I&#39;m not
that cool I don&#39;t have super skills I&#39;m
not a superhero but I do have a bamboo
bicycle and she&#39;s cool and that&#39;s my
defense but yeah but then I realized if
I am that simple
and I am doing that anyway it&#39;s maybe
because what I&#39;m doing is simple and
I&#39;ve started thinking about how this is
simple and how could we use this in
different ways of life in where and how
I&#39;ve used that before because somehow
even that&#39;s quite funny while I was
writing this speech it was a bad time
maybe I was in the desert in Kenya
crossing 55° Bush into thin air like
crazy that was damn hard but and then I
thought even doing that I was thinking
about the same things that my previous
life before this trip let&#39;s talk about
stability balance discipline focus
managing and evaluating risks to take
the next decisions this is not that
difference of the everyday life and yeah
I&#39;ve had some different life idea I
wasn&#39;t born cycling around the world
okay so before having this Woodstock
look I&#39;m a traveling cliche so before
that I was working in a private company
five times a week eight hours a day blah
blah yeah that was it and this is can be
it can be very nice but in my case I&#39;ve
decided to reboot my happiness in a
different way and that was
my first surprise because somehow we are
educated to use our best skills for the
same situations so I&#39;m not creating
anything new I&#39;m just using the same for
something different that&#39;s why I&#39;m not
that cool and I&#39;m doing that anyway so
this is kind of cool so everyone can be
cool so I have made one example to make
it like that to this world you know if
you can help me so please put your hands
up if you have or if you had a child
anyone and please keep your hands up
yeah you are a manager in a company okay
you have your own business oh no you
keep your hands up please
yeah so if you are or if you&#39;ve done a
university keep your hands up please
guys yeah so now guys please look around
yes look at around guys yeah so
basically I&#39;m talking about almost the
whole crowd yeah
and I&#39;m gonna make some questions that I
used to make to myself while I am
travelling when you were pregnant or
when your wife told you or your girl
when she told you that was it the right
time to have the baby maybe not what did
you have to think to do that anyway what
kind of risks you&#39;ve had to calculate to
build your company how many people told
you that was crazy so you did it anyway
managing the risks yeah how many times
you was working or studying and it had
some very nice invitations to do
something very nice especially in
Germany you have very nice beers guys
Thanks
how many times they they&#39;ve invited you
to do something and you didn&#39;t because
you was thinking about your next goals
because that was maybe better for your
next dreams and achievement so that&#39;s me
on the road yeah of course I&#39;m not
saying everyone can go cycling around
the world yeah basically because I have
enough moms hating me because I&#39;ve said
that previously to some people but
anyway I don&#39;t worry about that what I&#39;m
saying is we have different skills and
we use it for different things I have
many friends I I know many people they
are capable to build and have awesome
families and I&#39;m struggling to maybe one
day have a damn
dog so we have different skills and we
also have different ways to reach
balance yeah this is NZ bar and this is
Sara desert in summertime so yeah it
looks a bit scary maybe but it&#39;s somehow
simple and manageable because there is
older in this kind of chaos yeah I&#39;m
doing that barefoot because I like it
but also because I&#39;ve screwed my shoes
on that trip and I didn&#39;t have another
one so yeah but but let&#39;s talk about
some bad moments of this trip I&#39;ve
crossed three civil wars in Mozambique
Oh my house got burned in Zanzibar I&#39;ve
crossed two tribal wars in Kenya and
Ethiopia yeah I was robbed in my first
day of the strip in Cape Town I&#39;ve
crossed the Sahara Desert in summertime
yeah guys I&#39;ve eaten rats sand and trust
me there is people eating a scent and
actually you don&#39;t really wanna you
don&#39;t really want to know where I&#39;ve
been eating in where it came from
yeah and I&#39;ve passed by temperatures
between 55 and minus 20 this is actually
true however that&#39;s also me oh I love it
I remember this oops sorry
so that&#39;s also me in the other side
I&#39;ve been eating maybe let&#39;s see oh the
fresh food from from Zanzibar the fresh
vegetables from Mozambique the Arab food
from from from Sudan in Egypt the
Ethiopian coffee of the South African
wine I&#39;ve had a very low yeah and I love
eating by the way yeah and
yeah I know it&#39;s easy to notice but and
it&#39;s more than it&#39;s more than eating
around the world right because also with
Dulcinea I&#39;ve been cycling throughout
violet and orange sunrise and sunset
around the world guys I&#39;ve seen the sky
with more bright star than dark spots I
actually have my own star as after a
South African child gave it to me so
yeah and I could talk for days about how
and why I have my own star I&#39;ve made the
best friends of my life on the road and
I fell in love a couple of times what
gap doesn&#39;t doesn&#39;t matter yeah
moving on somehow we have different ways
to reach stability and when I talk about
these two extremes
I am also finding my way to reach
stability and I thought man if I&#39;m doing
that in an extreme way why I find that I
find this stable somehow and I found it
a very simple way to explain that it&#39;s
like a pigeon toss game you know let&#39;s
say this is this is my imaginary coin
because here the euro is expensive after
Africa so yeah so if you toss the coin
once yeah if you toss it once your line
is gonna go it dropped when your line is
gonna go high like this if you toss it
twice your line is gonna go higher or
it&#39;s gonna stabilize in the middle and
more often you toss the coin your line
is gonna go more and more to the middle
and then it&#39;s gonna stabilize in the 50
50 % what I&#39;m doing is basically tossing
the coin more often and this is my way
to find stability but of course you can
do this in so many other ways even
traveling let&#39;s say you can travel
without tossing the coin or doing it
less times yeah so book your flight book
your tour get a tour guide look for
recommendations Trip Advisor whatever to
find the best places and restaurants
you&#39;re gonna have a very good experience
probably but sometimes you&#39;re gonna have
the good the awesome but not the
unexpected best
but this is not important for everyone
however you&#39;re gonna have maybe some
beds but not the very worst
so tossing the coin less you find in
stability what I&#39;m doing doing this more
and more times is I&#39;m basically managing
the risks yeah and enjoying the best
times but we are not talking about
different things it&#39;s a coin issue so
yep
and yeah of course I can&#39;t say I&#39;m sorry
I can&#39;t say like you can just achieve
your dreams and do something and leave
your happy light because you need some
kind of wealthiness
yeah I have to be pragmatic in that
level too and I have to tell you guys
for me it&#39;s kind of easier because I
didn&#39;t want to show up before but I&#39;m
kind of reach I&#39;m actually meeting there
but I don&#39;t want to show that very much
but why nobody believes me because I&#39;m
barefoot okay but let&#39;s say I&#39;m not a
cool millionaire I may be a millionaire
of time
yeah I really think I&#39;m rich guys if
time is money I really think I am a
millionaire and I still want to be a
billionaire time works like this for me
and guys if time is money I think I&#39;m
walking like on the street like a like
an eccentric millionaire you know
throwing up my money and bunching faces
with a bunch of dollars that&#39;s me with
time you know and while I was on the
road ones after swaziland crossing the
border to Mozambique
a policeman stopped me the police used
to be very helpful in Africa to me and
even in Mozambique but this guy was just
looking for bribes so basically he said
oh I wouldn&#39;t like to share to search
all your things all your bags and I&#39;m
gonna take some time maybe two or three
hours and then I thought dude I have
food for a week I have water for two
days I have a tent it was like asking
$50 to Bill Gates you know and then I
say take your time and I took my I took
my stove and I took a book and I went to
make some coffee for me I was drinking
my coffee and after 30 minutes the
policeman gave up and say yeah go go go
go go go go go and
and then I saw no no wait please I
haven&#39;t finished my coffee and I made
one cup for me and one for the policeman
and we are friends now we still chatting
on whatsapp I know it can be cool data
but I still have to be more pragmatic
than that because of course you can&#39;t
pay your bills with time right of course
so I&#39;ve decided to have less bills and
again I&#39;m gonna use simple math simple
things to explain that let&#39;s say before
I used to have 100 but because of my
needs I always needed to buy more and
more I always needed 150 let&#39;s say now I
have 70 but I need 50 so by simple math
do you agree guys I&#39;m Richard Biffle
with 70 this is it and then I can start
talking about the redesign of speed
it is a cooler name somehow but at the
end is just simple physics right because
what I thought redesigning my way of
life and my speed from the point A to
the point B I don&#39;t do that just with
final high speed we do that with average
speed and direction so slowing my speed
and changing my direction somehow now
I&#39;m achieving more things for my life
going slower having less somehow I still
reach even with less and we can use that
for I can use that for my life for my
trip but you can use that in so many
levels we can use that even for because
that&#39;s my profession also for
sustainable development I work with
urban planning right and we have a very
funny example in Brazil last year the
mayor of são Paulo decided to reduce
the speed limit in at the busiest
highway highway of the city with that we
started having less accidents on the
road with less accidents we&#39;ve saved
some lives during this process and we&#39;d
had to stop less and the
average speed was increased so we came
faster from A to B this is cool right
not at all because this year they
increased the speed limits again yay
we&#39;re having more accidents and we going
slower from A to B but the car can go
faster yay yeah somehow and I can apply
this in many other levels we&#39;re not
doing what we have to do we are doing
what we are used to do in so many levels
and we can say yeah it&#39;s just car and we
know that because we we are improving
public transport Europe is cool and it
is by the way but somehow in so many
countries we&#39;ve started increasing
public transport policies and making the
cities more biking people friendly after
almost reaching the limit of destruction
because we didn&#39;t have fuel anymore or
it became too expensive or we just
didn&#39;t have enough spaces in the end of
space in the city with too much car so
we&#39;ve had to share it in so many other
ways that was it we still didn&#39;t do this
that much in Brazil in so many other
places because we still have a lot to
burn in a lot of spaces to fill with
cars or many other things so and then
I&#39;ve started thinking in how many other
things we are just waiting the limit of
destruction to start changing because
when you&#39;re talking about the way we
walk in we&#39;re just talking about going
fast apparently we have some new Isaac
Newton&#39;s trying to reinvent physics
going faster from A to B just with final
speed and guys it&#39;s just not like that
and my thing is we can go faster not
just with the final is about the way we
walk and the average speed sometimes you
have to increase it sometimes you have
to go slower it&#39;s not a matter of speed
it&#39;s a matter of rethinking and I&#39;m not
saying everyone have to go around the
world to do that being crazy no no no I
have enough mums don&#39;t do that guys
please what I&#39;m saying is you
go and do that in Ethiopia Sudan Vietnam
Nepal Brazil Germany Mannheim TEDx it&#39;s
a matter of choice and rethinking
thinking twice you can talk to your
neighbor you can talk to your family you
can talk to your colleagues here you can
read the news because it&#39;s so easy to go
very fast to the wrong direction or
sometimes I just need some rest to stop
and think and when I&#39;ve stopped to think
I&#39;ve done something in a different way
and I can tell you guys I never was
happier than I am now
because now I&#39;m doing what I want in the
way I want with who and where I want of
course this is not a hundred percent
nice but I&#39;m always looking for that so
I have good and bad as you saw and the
funny thing to prove my way of speed of
redesigning that is with my slow loosen
air I&#39;m achieving places where a Ferrari
can&#39;t make yep and yeah I don&#39;t want to
make this conversation very serious a
sustainable development and blah blahs
because I&#39;m not a serious person okay so
I want to finish that with a with a
puppy dog picture I&#39;m kidding yeah this
is my last picture and my life is
basically like this guys I&#39;m always
saying hello and goodbye to someone like
this villager this is the desert in
Kenya and yeah my life is basically like
that from A to B I have hello and I have
a goodbye what I&#39;m trying to do during
this process is taking the best from
everyone and everywhere around and I&#39;m
giving all my best in change so yeah
this is it so guys hi I&#39;m Ricardo this
is the best I have to give to you guys
and goodbye
[Applause]
