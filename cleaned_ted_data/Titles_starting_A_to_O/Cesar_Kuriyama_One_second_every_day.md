So, I&#39;m an artist.
I live in New York, and I&#39;ve been working in advertising
for -- ever since I left school,
so about seven, eight years now,
and it was draining.
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,
and I found myself never having time for all the projects
that I wanted to work on on my own.
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,
and it was called &quot;The power of time off,&quot;
and he spoke about how every seven years,
he takes a year off from work so he could
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,
and I just said, &quot;I have to do that. I have to take a year off.
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family
and start my own creative ideas.&quot;
So the first of those projects ended up being
something I called &quot;One Second Every Day.&quot;
Basically I&#39;m recording one second of every day of my life
for the rest of my life,
chronologically compiling these one-second
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video
until, you know, I can&#39;t record them anymore.

The purpose of this project is, one:
I hate not remembering things that I&#39;ve done in the past.
There&#39;s all these things that I&#39;ve done with my life
that I have no recollection of
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,
&quot;Oh yeah, that&#39;s something that I did.&quot;
And something that I realized early on in the project
was that if I wasn&#39;t doing anything interesting,
I would probably forget to record the video.
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,
because it&#39;s something that I really wanted to --
from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted
to keep this project going until forever,
and having missed that one second, I realized,
it just kind of created this thing in my head
where I never forgot ever again.
So if I live to see 80 years of age,
I&#39;m going to have a five-hour video
that encapsulates 50 years of my life.
When I turn 40, I&#39;ll have a one-hour video
that includes just my 30s.
This has really
invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,
to try and do something interesting with my day.
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,
as the days and weeks and months go by,
time just seems to start blurring
and blending into each other
and, you know, I hated that,
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.
You know, this project for me is a way for me
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I&#39;ve done.
Even just this one second allows me to remember
everything else I did that one day.
It&#39;s difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.
On a good day, I&#39;ll have maybe three or four seconds
that I really want to choose,
but I&#39;ll just have to narrow it down to one,
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me
to remember the other three anyway.
It&#39;s also kind of a protest, a personal protest,
against the culture we have now where people
just are at concerts with their cell phones out
recording the whole concert, and they&#39;re disturbing you.
They&#39;re not even enjoying the show.
They&#39;re watching the concert through their cell phone.
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,
back in the day, and I&#39;ve decided that the best way
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life
and not be that person, is to just record that one second
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,
&quot;Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert.&quot;
And it just takes a quick, quick second.
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.
It was something that I&#39;ve been dreaming about doing my whole life,
just driving around the U.S. and Canada
and just figuring out where to go the next day,
and it was kind of outstanding.
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip
for the savings that I had to take my year off,
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time
with friends working on a really neat project.
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,
and this really tragic thing happened where
my sister-in-law,
her intestine suddenly strangled one day,
and we took her to the emergency room,
and she was, she was in really bad shape.
We almost lost her a couple of times,
and I was there with my brother every day.
It helped me realize something else during this project,
is that recording that one second on a really bad day
is extremely difficult.
It&#39;s not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we&#39;re doing awesome things.
Or we&#39;re, &quot;Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture.&quot;
But we rarely do that when we&#39;re having a bad day,
and something horrible is happening.
And I found that it&#39;s actually been very, very important
to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.
It really helps you appreciate the good times.
It&#39;s not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,
I think it&#39;s important to remember it,
just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.
Now one of the things that I do is I don&#39;t use any filters,
I don&#39;t use anything to -- I try to capture the moment
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.
I started a rule of first person perspective.
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn&#39;t the way to go.
The way to really remember what I saw
was to record it as I actually saw it.
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,
wouldn&#39;t it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?
I turned 31 last week, which is there.
I think it would be interesting to see
what everyone did with a project like this.
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.
Personally, I&#39;m tired of forgetting,
and this is a really easy thing to do.
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --
most people in this room, I bet --
and it&#39;s something that&#39;s --
I never want to forget another day that I&#39;ve ever lived,
and this is my way of doing that,
and it&#39;d be really interesting also to see,
if you could just type in on a website,
&quot;June 18, 2018,&quot;
and you would just see a stream of people&#39;s lives
on that particular day from all over the world.
And I don&#39;t know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,
and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,
so you can never forget that that day, you lived.
Thank you.

(Applause)
