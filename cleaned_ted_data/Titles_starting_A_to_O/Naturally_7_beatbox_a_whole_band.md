♫ I think I&#39;m ready to do my thing ♫
♫ I think I&#39;m ready to take my chances ♫
♫ I&#39;ve been dining out and all stressed out ♫
♫ Due to the circumstances. See? ♫
♫ I gotta get up, get up, get up, get up ♫
♫ Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up ♫
♫ I see what you&#39;re saying ♫
♫ We sent a demo to the world, they said it sounds like Take 6 ♫
♫ I said &quot;Hold on, wait a minute, I&#39;ll be back with the remix&quot; ♫
♫ They looking at us funny, we can&#39;t make any money ♫
♫ It took us years to figure out that we was dealing with dummies ♫
♫ They didn&#39;t understand the sound from the Bronx, that&#39;s the boogie down ♫
♫ to Huntsville, Alabama, there&#39;s no circles in my planner, so ♫
♫ It was time to make the product, so we hooked up with Townsend ♫
♫ Made a deal with John Neal, on the road sold ten thousand ♫
♫ WBA, that means a trip to Nashville ♫
♫ Festplatte showed up and said them boys are naturals ♫
♫ Can you hear what they were hearing? See what they were seeing? ♫
♫ From Bronx to Berlin, we took the tour European ♫
♫ All vocal yeah, we widit, call the album &quot;What is it?&quot; ♫
♫ With Sarah Connor, set the goal for number one and we hit it ♫
♫ But now it&#39;s Kev, Sim, Drew, Stew, time for a new day ♫
♫ Ring the alarm, hit &#39;em on Skype or a two-way ♫
♫ Sung by the words, we ready to fly! ♫
♫ Fly baby! Time to leave that nest ♫
♫ Fly baby! This ain&#39;t no time to rest ♫
♫ Come on fly baby, we got work to do ♫
