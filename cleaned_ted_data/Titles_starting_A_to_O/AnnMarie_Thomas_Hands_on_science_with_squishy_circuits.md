I&#39;m a huge believer in hands-on education.
But you have to have the right tools.
If I&#39;m going to teach my daughter about electronics,
I&#39;m not going to give her a soldering iron.
And similarly, she finds prototyping boards
really frustrating for her little hands.
So my wonderful student Sam and I

decided to look at the most tangible thing we could think of:
Play-Doh.
And so we spent a summer
looking at different Play-Doh recipes.
And these recipes probably look really familiar
to any of you who have made homemade play-dough --
pretty standard ingredients you probably have in your kitchen.
We have two favorite recipes --
one that has these ingredients
and a second that had sugar instead of salt.
And they&#39;re great. We can make great little sculptures with these.
But the really cool thing about them is when we put them together.
You see that really salty Play-Doh?
Well, it conducts electricity.
And this is nothing new.
It turns out that regular Play-Doh that you buy at the store conducts electricity,
and high school physics teachers have used that for years.
But our homemade play-dough
actually has half the resistance of commercial Play-Doh.
And that sugar dough?
Well it&#39;s 150 times more resistant to electric current
than that salt dough.
So what does that mean?
Well it means if you them together you suddenly have circuits --
circuits that the most creative, tiny, little hands
can build on their own.

(Applause)

And so I want to do a little demo for you.
So if I take this salt dough,
again, it&#39;s like the play-dough you probably made as kids,
and I plug it in --
it&#39;s a two-lead battery pack, simple battery pack,
you can buy them at Radio Shack
and pretty much anywhere else --
we can actually then
light things up.
But if any of you have studied electrical engineering,
we can also create a short circuit.
If I push these together, the light turns off.
Right, the current wants to run through the play-dough, not through that LED.
If I separate them again, I have some light.
Well now if I take that sugar dough,
the sugar dough doesn&#39;t want to conduct electricity.
It&#39;s like a wall to the electricity.
If I place that between, now all the dough is touching,
but if I stick that light back in,
I have light.
In fact, I could even add some movement to my sculptures.
If I want a spinning tail, let&#39;s grab a motor,
put some play-dough on it, stick it on
and we have spinning.

(Applause)

And once you have the basics,
we can make a slightly more complicated circuit.
We call this our sushi circuit. It&#39;s very popular with kids.
I plug in again the power to it.
And now I can start talking about parallel and series circuits.
I can start plugging in lots of lights.
And we can start talking about things like electrical load.
What happens if I put in lots of lights
and then add a motor?
It&#39;ll dim.
We can even add microprocessors
and have this as an input
and create squishy sound music that we&#39;ve done.
You could do parallel and series circuits
for kids using this.
So this is all in your home kitchen.
We&#39;ve actually tried to turn it into an electrical engineering lab.
We have a website, it&#39;s all there. These are the home recipes.
We&#39;ve got some videos. You can make them yourselves.
And it&#39;s been really fun since we put them up to see where these have gone.
We&#39;ve had a mom in Utah who used them with her kids,
to a science researcher in the U.K.,
and curriculum developers in Hawaii.
So I would encourage you all to grab some Play-Doh,
grab some salt, grab some sugar and start playing.
We don&#39;t usually think of our kitchen as an electrical engineering lab
or little kids as circuit designers,
but maybe we should.
Have fun. Thank you.

(Applause)
