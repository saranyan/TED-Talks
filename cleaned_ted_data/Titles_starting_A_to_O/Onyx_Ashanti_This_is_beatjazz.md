Text: BeatJazz.

BeatJazz is:
1. Live looping,
2. Jazz improvisation
And
3. &quot;Gestural&quot; sound design.
Accelerometers
on each hand
read hand position.
The color of the lights
indicates which sound I am playing.
Red = Drums,
Blue = Bass,
Green = Chords,
Orange = Leads,
Purple = Pads
The mouthpiece
consists of ...
a button,
two guitar picks
and lots of hot glue.
The heads-up display
is a smartphone that displays system parameters.
Why?
To atomize music culture
so that ALL past, present and future genres
can be studied and abstracted, live.
And
&quot;BeatJazzers&quot;
become as common as D.J.&#39;s.
But mostly ...
to MAKE the future
rather than wait for it.

(Applause)
