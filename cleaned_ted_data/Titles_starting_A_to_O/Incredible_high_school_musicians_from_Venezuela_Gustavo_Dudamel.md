Gustavo Dudamel: Hi everybody in L.A.
Hi Quincy. Hi Maestro Zander. Hi Mark.
We are very happy to have the possibility to be with you
in the other side of the world.
We can speak only with music.
We are very happy
because we have the opportunity
to have this angel in the world --
not only in our country, Venezuela,
but in our world.
He has given us the possibility
to have dreams and to make true the dreams.
And here are the results
of this wonderful project

in all Americas.
And we want to play a little piece for you
