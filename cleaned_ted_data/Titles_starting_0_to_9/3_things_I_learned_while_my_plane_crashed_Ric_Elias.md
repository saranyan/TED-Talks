Imagine a big explosion
as you climb through 3,000 ft.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine
going clack, clack, clack.
It sounds scary.
Well, I had a unique seat that day.
I was sitting in 1D.
I was the only one who could talk
to the flight attendants.
So I looked at them right away,
and they said, &quot;No problem.
We probably hit some birds.&quot;
The pilot had already
turned the plane around,
and we weren&#39;t that far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later,
three things happened at the same time.
The pilot lines up the plane
with the Hudson River.
That&#39;s usually not the route.

(Laughter)

He turns off the engines.
Now, imagine being
in a plane with no sound.
And then he says three words.
The most unemotional
three words I&#39;ve ever heard.
He says, &quot;Brace for impact.&quot;
I didn&#39;t have to talk
to the flight attendant anymore.

(Laughter)

I could see in her eyes, it was terror.
Life was over.
Now I want to share with you three things
I learned about myself that day.
I learned that it
all changes in an instant.
We have this bucket list,
we have these things
we want to do in life,
and I thought about all the people
I wanted to reach out to that I didn&#39;t,
all the fences I wanted to mend,
all the experiences I wanted
to have and I never did.
As I thought about that later on,
I came up with a saying,
which is, &quot;I collect bad wines.&quot;
Because if the wine is ready
and the person is there, I&#39;m opening it.
I no longer want to postpone
anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose,
has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day --
and this is as we clear
the George Washington Bridge,
which was by not a lot --

(Laughter)

I thought about, wow,
I really feel one real regret.
I&#39;ve lived a good life.
In my own humanity and mistakes,
I&#39;ve tried to get better
at everything I tried.
But in my humanity,
I also allow my ego to get in.
And I regretted the time I wasted
on things that did not matter
with people that matter.
And I thought about
my relationship with my wife,
with my friends, with people.
And after, as I reflected on that,
I decided to eliminate
negative energy from my life.
It&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s a lot better.
I&#39;ve not had a fight
with my wife in two years.
It feels great.
I no longer try to be right;
I choose to be happy.
The third thing I learned --
and this is as your mental clock
starts going, &quot;15, 14, 13.&quot;
You can see the water coming.
I&#39;m saying, &quot;Please blow up.&quot;
I don&#39;t want this thing
to break in 20 pieces
like you&#39;ve seen in those documentaries.
And as we&#39;re coming down,
I had a sense of, wow, dying is not scary.
It&#39;s almost like we&#39;ve been preparing
for it our whole lives.
But it was very sad.
I didn&#39;t want to go; I love my life.
And that sadness
really framed in one thought,
which is, I only wish for one thing.
I only wish I could see my kids grow up.
About a month later,
I was at a performance by my daughter --
first-grader, not much artistic talent --

(Laughter)

Yet!

(Laughter)

And I&#39;m bawling,
I&#39;m crying, like a little kid.
And it made all the sense
in the world to me.
I realized at that point,
by connecting those two dots,
that the only thing
that matters in my life
is being a great dad.
Above all, above all,
the only goal I have in life
is to be a good dad.
I was given the gift of a miracle,
of not dying that day.
I was given another gift,
which was to be able
to see into the future
and come back
and live differently.
I challenge you guys
that are flying today,
imagine the same thing
happens on your plane --
and please don&#39;t --
but imagine, and how would you change?
What would you get done
that you&#39;re waiting to get done
because you think you&#39;ll be here forever?
How would you change your relationships
and the negative energy in them?
And more than anything,
are you being the best parent you can?
Thank you.

(Applause)
