♫ Picture yourself in a world where there&#39;s no one else, ♫
♫ nobody anywhere. ♫
♫ A moment ago, there were voices and faces to look upon, ♫
♫ you can&#39;t see them anywhere. ♫
♫ Nothing more to say ♫
♫ and no one left to say it to, anyway. ♫
♫ Oh, listen to what I say. ♫
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫
♫ Now picture a world where the people all feel their worth. ♫
♫ Children are everywhere. ♫
♫ Now there is a reason for everyone&#39;s time on Earth. ♫
♫ Wondering why you should care, yeah. ♫
♫ Nothing more to say ♫
♫ and only love can see us through, anyway. ♫
♫ Oh, listen what I say, yeah. ♫
♫ Everybody can be somebody ♫
♫ and everybody is free to make a difference. ♫
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference. ♫
♫ You don&#39;t have to be a big celebrity ♫
♫ to feel the power, the power in your soul, no. ♫
♫ You don&#39;t have to be a big star on MTV ♫
♫ to realize that in your eyes is a view that only you can see. ♫
♫ Everybody can be somebody. ♫
♫ Everybody is free to make a difference in this world. ♫
♫ You can make a little difference in this world. ♫

This is a song that came about
because I think it&#39;s difficult to be in the world
and not be aware of what&#39;s going on,
and the wars and so forth.
This song kind of came out of all of that.
And I wrote a lot of happy songs on my first record,
which I still stand by,
but this has got something else in it.
It&#39;s called &quot;Peace on Earth.&quot;
♫ There is no hope. ♫
♫ There is no future. ♫
♫ No faith in God to save the day. ♫
♫ There is no reason, no understanding ♫
♫ no sacred place to hide away. ♫
♫ There is no earnest conversation. ♫
♫ No words of wisdom from the wise. ♫
♫ There is no reconciliation ♫
♫ and no collective compromise. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we want. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we all say. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫
♫ There is no darkness, no sunshine. ♫
♫ There is no great society. ♫
♫ There is no freedom without conviction. ♫
♫ There is no freedom to be free. ♫
♫ There is no heaven, no fire and brimstone. ♫
♫ There is no brotherhood of man. ♫
♫ There is no country, no one religion. ♫
♫ There is no universal plan. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we want. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we all say. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
♫ Yet, there in the hallway ♫
♫ lurks the ghost of war. ♫
♫ He wants more, and more, and more, and more, ♫
♫ and more, and more, and more, and more, and more. ♫
♫ The answer is ♫
♫ mutual-assured destruction, ♫
♫ a balance of power, ♫
♫ a weapon for everyone. ♫
♫ Mutual-assured destruction ♫
♫ bringing peace to everyone. ♫
(Trumpet sounds)
(Trumpet sounds)
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we want. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth, ♫
♫ that&#39;s what we all say. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
♫ There in the hallway, ♫
♫ peace on Earth. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫
♫ Peace on Earth. ♫

(Applause)
