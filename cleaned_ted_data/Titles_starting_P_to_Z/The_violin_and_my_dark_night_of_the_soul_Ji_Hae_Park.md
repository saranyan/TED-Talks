Thank you.
Hi, everybody.
Ban-gap-seum-ni-da.
I&#39;d like to share with you a little bit of me
playing my life.
I might look successful and happy
being in front of you today,
but I once suffered from severe depression
and was in total despair.
The violin, which meant everything to me,
became a grave burden on me.
Although many people tried to comfort and encourage me,
their words sounded like meaningless noise.
When I was just about to give everything up
after years of suffering,
I started to rediscover the true power of music.
(Music)
In the midst of hardship,
it was the music that gave me -- that restored my soul.
The comfort the music gave me
was just indescribable,
and it was a real eye-opening experience for me too,
and it totally changed my perspective on life
and set me free from the pressure
of becoming a successful violinist.
Do you feel like you are all alone?
I hope that this piece will touch and heal your heart,
as it did for me.
(Music)

(Applause)

Thank you.
Now, I use my music to reach people&#39;s hearts
and have found there are no boundaries.
My audience is anyone who is here to listen,
even those who are not familiar with classical music.
I not only play at the prestigious classical concert halls
like Carnegie Hall and Kennedy Center,
but also hospitals, churches, prisons,
and restricted facilities for leprosy patients,
just to mention a few.
Now, with my last piece, I&#39;d like to show you
that classical music can be so much fun, exciting,
and that it can rock you.
Let me introduce you to my brand new project,
&quot;Baroque in Rock,&quot;
which became a golden disc most recently.
It&#39;s such an honor for me.
I think, while I&#39;m enjoying my life as a happy musician,
I&#39;m earning a lot more recognition than I&#39;ve ever imagined.
But it&#39;s now your turn.
Changing your perspectives
will not only transform you but also the whole world.
Just play your life with all you have,
and share it with the world.
I really look forward to witnessing
a transforming world by you, TEDsters.
Play your life, and stay tuned.
(Music)

(Applause)
