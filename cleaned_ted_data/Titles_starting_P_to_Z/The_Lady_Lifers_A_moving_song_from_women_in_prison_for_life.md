Dannielle Hadley: Life

in Pennsylvania means just that:
life without the possibility of parole.
For us lifers,
as we call ourselves,
our only chance for release
is through commutation,
which has only been granted
to two women since 1989,
close to 30 years ago.
Our song, &quot;This Is Not Our Home,&quot;
it tells of our experiences
while doing life without
the possibility of parole.

Brenda Watkins: I&#39;m a woman.
I&#39;m a grandmother.
I&#39;m a daughter.
I have a son.
I&#39;m not an angel.
I&#39;m not the devil.
I came to jail
when I was so young.
I spend my time here
inside these prison walls.
Lost friends to death,
saw some go home.
Watch years pass,
people come and go,
while I do life without parole.
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I&#39;ve done.
I&#39;m doing time here.
This is not my home.
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.
Will I see
my family
or die alone?
As the years go by,
I hold back my tears,
because if I cry I&#39;d give in to fear.
I must be strong, have to hold on.
Gotta get through
another year.
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I&#39;ve done.
I&#39;m doing time here.
This is not my home.
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.
Will I see
my family
or die alone?
I&#39;m not saying that I&#39;m not guilty,
I&#39;m not saying that I shouldn&#39;t pay.
All I&#39;m asking is for forgiveness.
Gotta have hope I&#39;ll be free someday.
Is there a place for me
in the world out there?
Will they ever know or care
that I&#39;m chained?
Is there redemption for the sin
of my younger days?
Because I&#39;ve changed.
Lord knows I&#39;ve changed.
I am a prisoner
for the wrong I&#39;ve done.
I&#39;m doing time here.
This is not my home.
Dream of freedom, hope for mercy.
Will I see
my family
or die alone?
Will I see
my family
or die alone?
