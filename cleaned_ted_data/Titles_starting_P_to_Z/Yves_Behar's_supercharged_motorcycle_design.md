Forrest North: The beginning of any collaboration
starts with a conversation.
And I would like to share with you
some of the bits of the conversation that we started with.
I grew up in a log cabin in Washington state
with too much time on my hands.

Yves Behar: And in scenic Switzerland for me.

FN: I always had a passion for alternative vehicles.
This is a land yacht racing across the desert in Nevada.

YB: Combination of windsurfing and skiing into this invention there.

FN: And I also had an interest in dangerous inventions.
This is a 100,000-volt Tesla coil
that I built in my bedroom,
much to the dismay of my mother.

YB: To the dismay of my mother,
this is dangerous teenage fashion right there.

(Laughter)


FN: And I brought this all together,
this passion with alternative energy and raced a solar car across Australia --
also the U.S. and Japan.

YB: So, wind power, solar power -- we had a lot to talk about.
We had a lot that got us excited.
So we decided to do a special project together.
To combine engineering and design and ...

FN: Really make a fully integrated product, something beautiful.

YB: And we made a baby.

(Laughter)


FN: Can you bring out our baby?

(Applause)

This baby is fully electric.
It goes 150 miles an hour.
It&#39;s twice the range of any electric motorcycle.
Really the exciting thing about a motorcycle
is just the beautiful integration of engineering and design.
It&#39;s got an amazing user experience.
It was wonderful working with Yves Behar.
He came up with our name and logo. We&#39;re Mission Motors.
And we&#39;ve only got three minutes,
but we could talk about it for hours.

YB: Thank you.

FN: Thank you TED. And thank you Chris, for having us.

(Applause)
